# RelyMe
RelyMe is a secure app that helps you to store your blockchain wallet's address and private key.

# Introduction
In the real world, we don't store our cash in plain sight. We either store it in a safe or we deposit it in a bank. In the virtual world, same rules apply. You don't want to store your private key in a text file or in a screenshot. RelyMe is your virtual safe. It stores all your wallet information with encryption in your local storage. No one except you can reach to that information.

# How to Use
  * Download "RelyMe" app in Google Play Store. 
  * For the first run, it will ask you to create a password. So create a single password to store all your wallet information in a single app.
  * After successfully creating a password, you are free to use our app.
  * You can add as many wallets as you want using the 'Encrypt' button.
  * After you create a wallet, it will add the encrypted version of the wallet with its label to the list.
  * If you would like to see your 12-word phrase or your private key, press the decrypt button and enter the wallet label you want to decrypt.
# Login Options
 * Once you create your password, you can add new login options such as:
   * Face Recognition
   * Fingerprint
# Forgot Password
If you forgot your password, you can use biometrics(fingerprint or face recognition) to login and change your password from settings. If you did not activate any of those, your information cannot be reached and lost forever.
